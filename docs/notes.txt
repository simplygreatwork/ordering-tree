order_item_increment in order_import
	might need
		order_item_quantity(2)
		order_item_quantity(+1)
		order_item_quantity(-1)
	or
		order_item_set_quantity
	or
		just call order_item_increment multiple times
			possibly - but consider that item might default to 1
			so would need order_item_set_quantity or subtract 1

need to validate order order_import
	like catalog import

catalog aliasing
	/sandwich/burger/combo = /combo-drink-fry
	/sandwich/burger/drink = /combo-drink
	/sandwich/burger/fry = /combo-fry
but would also need to prevent display as a top level menu
	make it a private menu
can still refer to paths either like
	/combo-drink/fountain/flavor/coke
		or
	/sandwich/burger/drink/fountain/flavor/coke

continue to work on interacting with order menu views
	idea: notice if incomplete selections
	idea: for each menu, choose next in line

I substracted 0.10 from a catalog item and ended with x.1000009
	how to prevent this?

implement
	/sandwich/burger label:Hamburger

to calculate total of an item
	need compound multipliers
		3 a
			3 b
				3 c
	so there are 3 a, 9 b, 27 c
	as you descend walk, the multiplier changes

maybe walk filter can change the multiplier

example for catalog import...
let example = `/sandwich p:0 l:Burger q:0 m:no s:no`

tell how many tests passed versus failed of total

for order_append
	ensure the path is /xxxxx/xxxxx (at level 2)

maybe use command line like arguments
	
when validating an order
	return the node which requires a choice
